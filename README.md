# ![Big Shot BBS logo](favicon.png) Big Shot Bounty Board System

Big Shot is an unofficial, fan-made random bounty generator for **WANTED! REWARD: CC 10,000** wargame.

[Try it out!](https://bigshotbbs.github.io/)

All random tables, except for the name generator, were taken verbatim from the **W!R:CC10K** rulebook. No extra effort was made to validate or create cohesive characters. Embrace the jank.

All bounties are generated and stored in your browser, and never leave your computer. This is intentional and, while good in principle (privacy), it also means it's impossible to share a link to a specific bounty with someone else. Until proper sharing is implemented, please use screenshots or print bounties to pdf.
